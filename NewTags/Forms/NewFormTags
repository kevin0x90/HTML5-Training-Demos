New Formtags 
<progress> Progressbar whose style depends on the browser implementation
and the operating system progressbar style. 

<datalist> contains a list of data and can be combined with the other tags 
eg input elements with the list="" attribute set to a datalist.

<output> can contain values from other tags by "databinding" 
for example an input has a onchange event then the onchange event 
can reference the output tag by its id and assign the current value 
by value.
