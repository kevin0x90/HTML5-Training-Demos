Webworkers are parts of javascript which are processed in an own thread
then the main page. Threadstarter and thread communicate with a message 
system. 
for example:

threadStarter [Message: get a lot of employees and create dynamicly html for each employee]
	-> thread
	   thread [Processes the task]
thread [Message JSON object with the employee informations and the prebuilded html]
   -> threadStarter
   
a web worker has some restrictions which are the following 
the web worker has no access to the DOM or DOM events.

A web worker can use the following setInterval / setTimeout
and events depending on the worker itself for example the message event.
Web worker can also use xmlhttprequest but note you can't use jquery 
ajax methods in a web worker cause jquery needs access to the DOM which 
isn't available in a web worker. Workers have access to the navigator object 
and its propertys and the importScripts function to import additional javascript code 
in the worker for example librarys. Worker can create sub workers.
