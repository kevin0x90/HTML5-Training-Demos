This repository contains all demo code is used 
for a training course i gave for a quick overview
of HTML5 for developers who are new to HTML5.

The main focus of the demos are the new Javascript
APIs available in HTML5. But there are also demos 
for plain HTML5 like the new tags available in the 
markup. 

Most of this code is just to demo some special 
API of feature so i tried to keep the demos on a
small size and avoided external script files where 
it was possible. 

I think i will do some refactoring of the demos 
in the near feature to make them more cleaner.
